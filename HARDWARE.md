## Computing

You can go either with an ESP8266/ESP32 or with a linux based micro computer
(Raspberry Pi/Orange Pi/Pine64).

Here's a few recommendations. Note the time of writing: *2016-09-11*, there will
be better hardware coming out afterward! Price trade off will vary too.

If you don't want to fiddle with [Armbian](http://www.armbian.com), you are
always safe with a Raspberry Pi with [Raspbian Jessie
Lite](http://raspbian.org/), albeit at a few bucks more.


### Wifi + Large SD

Particularly useful if you plan to do video recording on the host.

Orange Pi Lite is great at 12$USD (+4$ shipping). Add a Samsung >=32Gb EVO+
SDCard (<10$USD).


### Wifi, 8Gb flash

Orange Pi Plus is reasonable at 20$USB (+4$ shipping), has integrated 8Gb flash
and wifi, so the total cost is significantly less. It is sometimes listed as
Orange Pi PC Plus.


### Wired + Large SD

NanoPI NEO is cost effective at 7$USD (+5$ shipping!?). Add a Samsung EVO+
>=32Gb EVO+ SD Card (<10$USD).
