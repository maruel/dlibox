# PSF consolefont loader

This library is incomplete and needs to be refactored. It needs to be modified
to conform to the interface `font.Face` in
[golang.org/x/image/font](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/image/font#Face).

Please refer to [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/maruel/psf?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/maruel/psf).
