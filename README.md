# dlibox-esp

The box for funny people.

It is closely related to https://github.com/maruel/dlibox-go.


## Setup

dlibox-esp uses the following tools and their dependencies:

- [Sming](https://github.com/SmingHub/Sming)
  - [esp-open-sdk](https://github.com/pfalcon/esp-open-sdk)
  - [esptool](https://github.com/themadinventor/esptool)
  - [esptool2](https://github.com/raburton/esptool2)

I wrote a [script](setup.sh) to install and/or update these on Ubuntu, otherwise
follow the wiki pages which explains all the steps for your OS.

This project doesn't use the Arduino SDK. Someone posted an [explanation
why](https://primalcortex.wordpress.com/2015/10/22/esp8266-sming-how-to-start/).
