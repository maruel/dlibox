# Notes

Random thoughts while investigating for this project.


## CSS-only frameworks

Here's the ones that were looked at.

- https://github.com/basscss/basscss
- https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton
- https://github.com/jgthms/bulma
- https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons
- https://github.com/yahoo/pure

Skeleton was chosen because it was the simplest one.


## Color pickers

Colors pickers are notoriously bad. Looking specifically at the ones that do not
require jquery.

- http://www.daviddurman.com/flexi-color-picker/ doesn't support page zoom on
  desktop but on the other hand it doesn't need jquery nor a PNG.
- https://github.com/PitPik/colorPicker; kinda huge.
- http://www.menucool.com/color-picker
- <input type="color" name="background_color">
  - http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/ui/colorpicker
- https://github.com/wieringen/tinycolorpicker doesn't have native color wheel
  :(
