[Unit]
Description=Runs dlibox automatically upon boot
After=auditd.service

[Service]
Restart=always

# 1) One way is to run it as user and use capabilities to let it bind to port
# 80. This means access to SPI (and optionally Pi-blaster) still need to be
# configured accordingly.
ExecStartPre=/sbin/setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /home/pi/bin/dlibox
ExecStart=/bin/su - pi -c "/home/pi/bin/dlibox -port 80"

# 2) You may just run as root, which is sad but not a big deal if you don't
# anything personal on it.
#ExecStart=/home/pi/bin/dlibox -port 80

# 3) Another way is to run as user but use iptables instead of setcap.
#ExecStartPre=iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080 && iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -o lo -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
#ExecStart=/bin/su - pi -c "/home/pi/bin/dlibox -port 80"
