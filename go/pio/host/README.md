Host contains everything that relates to the host itself, including its CPU. It
contains all the buses that are connection points where devices can be connected
on.

* [cpu](cpu) exposes information about the CPU
* [hosttest](hosttest) implements fakes to be used for unit testing
* [ir](ir) exposes infra red remote support via lircd
* [pine64](pine64) exposes [Pine64](https://www.pine64.org/) specific hardware
  functionality, i.e.  headers pinout.
* [pins](pins) exposes GPIO functionality as found on the CPU driver, if any is
  found. Otherwise fallbacks to gpio sysfs, if available. 
* [rpi](rpi) exposes [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) specific

* [sysfs](sysfs) exposes based sysfs hardware interfaces, including IÂ²C and SPI.
