# pio - Design

This document dives into some of the designs. Read more about the goals at
[GOALS.md](GOALS.md).

## Registries

### Driver registry

The core of extensibility is implemented as an in-process driver registry. The
things that make it work are:
* Clear priority classes via
  [pio.Type](https://godoc.org/github.com/maruel/dlibox/go/pio#Type).
  Each category is loaded one after the other so a driver of a type can assume
  that all relevant drivers of lower level types were fully loaded.
* Native way to skip a driver on unrelated platform.
  * At compile time via conditional compilation.
  * At runtime via early `Init()` exit.
* Native way to return the state of all registered drivers. The ones loaded, the
  ones skipped and the ones that failed.
* Native way to declare inter-driver dependency. A specialized
  [Processor](https://godoc.org/github.com/maruel/dlibox/go/pio#Type)
  driver may dependent on generic
  [Processor](https://godoc.org/github.com/maruel/dlibox/go/pio#Type)
  driver and the drivers will be loaded sequentially.
* In another other case, the drivers are loaded in parallel for minimum total
  latency.


### Other registries

Many packages under [protocols/](../../protocols) and
[host/headers](../../host/headers) contains small focused registries. The goal
is to not have a one-size-fits-all approach that would require broad
generalization; when a user needs an IÂ²C bus handle, the user knows they can
find it in [protocols/i2c](../../protocols/i2c). It's is assumed the user knows
what bus to use in the first place. Strict type typing guides the user towards
providing the right object.

The packages follow the `Register()` and `All()` pattern. At `drivers.Init()`
time, each driver registers themselves in the relevant components. Then the
application can query for the available components, based on the type of
hardware desired. For each of these registries, registering the same pseudo name
twice is an error. This helps reducing ambiguity for the users.


## pins

There's a strict separation between
[analog](https://godoc.org/github.com/maruel/dlibox/go/pio/protocols/analog#PinIO),
[digital
(gpio)](https://godoc.org/github.com/maruel/dlibox/go/pio/protocols/gpio#PinIO)
and [generic
pins](https://godoc.org/github.com/maruel/dlibox/go/pio/protocols/pins#Pin). The
common base is
[pins.Pin](https://godoc.org/github.com/maruel/dlibox/go/pio/protocols/pins#Pin),
which is a purely generic pin. This describes GROUND,
VCC, etc. Each pin is registered by the relevant device driver at initialization
time and has a unique name. The same pin may be present multiple times on a
header.

The only pins not registered are the INVALID ones. There's one generic
at
[pins.INVALID](https://godoc.org/github.com/maruel/dlibox/go/pio/protocols/pins#INVALID)
and two specialized,
[analog.INVALID](https://godoc.org/github.com/maruel/dlibox/go/pio/protocols/analog#INVALID)
and
[gpio.INVALID](https://godoc.org/github.com/maruel/dlibox/go/pio/protocols/gpio#INVALID).


## Edge based triggering and input pull resistor

CPU drivers can have immediate access to the GPIO pins by leveraging memory
mapped GPIO registers. The main problem with this approach is that one looses
access to interrupted based edge detection, as this requires kernel coordination
to route the interrupt back to the user. This is resolved by to use the GPIO
memory for everything _except_ for edge detection. The CPU drivers has the job
of hiding this fact to the users and make the dual-use transparent.

Using CPU specific drivers enable changing input pull resistor, which sysfs
notoriously doesn't expose.

The setup described above enables the best of both world, low latency read and
write, and CPU-less edge detection, all without the user knowing about the
intricate details!
