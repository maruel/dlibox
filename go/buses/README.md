# Buses

Buses are connection points where devices can be connected on.

* i2c uses sysfs to communicate with multiple devices on a IÂ²C bus
* ir uses lircd to send and receive infra red based remote signals
* rpi implements GPIO use on BCM283x CPU plus hardware header representation
* spi uses sysfs to communicate with a device on a SPI bus
