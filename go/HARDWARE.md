# Required Hardware

- Raspberry Pi (1, 2 or 3) + its own power supply + wifi adaptor or ethernet
  connected for the web server.
- Raspberry Pi case to stick a breadboard over.
- One or many APA102-C LED strip (Dotstar).
  - One of the nice thing from these is that the chip is rated for -40Â°C so
    buying a weatherproof strip + long cables is worth it.
  - You can source from Pololu, Adafruits, Amazon (in the US) or Aliexpress
    or Alibaba (elsewhere in the world).
- One 74AHCT125N to safely upgrade the SPI signal from 3.3V to 5V.
- One large (>=10A) 5V power supply per ~400 LEDs.
- Power wires for the same length of the strip to lower resistance (I used 18
  AWG).
- Small breadboard that can stick on the Raspberry Pi case.
- Small wires to connect from the Pi to the breadboard.
